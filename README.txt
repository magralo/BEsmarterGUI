What is in this project?

This app is developed to make easier applications of Bayesian regression analysis. It is designed thinking about applied researchers and practitioners without programming skills. There are lots a packages that made easy to do a Bayesian regression analysis in R. However, users require programming skills. We want to overcome this requirement such that applied researchers and practitioners applied Bayesian techniques in a very easy graphical environment. In addition, we have in the "Help tab" in our app a paper called “A GUIded tour around Bayesian regression” where all technical concepts are presented such that users can know all underlying theory. This paper also includes a brief user guide.

Usage:
Once you are on your own temporary copy just write shiny::runApp() in the command line, that would be enough to launch the app (maybe you will have to allow the emerging window).

We encourage anyone who wants to use our app to do it. There is a folder named "dataSim" where users can find some toy files that they can use to start using our app (see Table 3 in our paper: “A GUIded tour around Bayesian regression”, “Help tab” in our app for details). In addition, users can try our app using their own datasets. We welcome any comments and feedback.
